Hotkeys app for older "unsupported" laptops for Windows 10

Built using Visual Studio 2015 CE
Nuget dependencies: 
- NAudio (for getting global volume / mute status)

This program requires Samsung's BIOS interface driver and DLL, but getting them can be tricky. They need to be extracted from Samsung's EasySettings package, which doesn't want to install under Windows 10.
